/* touch.h - an on-screen pad for touch screens (PORT EXTRA, the SDL builds; on by default on Android, elsewhere with
 * WOODY_TOUCH=1). The left part of the screen is a floating stick, the right part has the face buttons (A jump, B duck,
 * X attack, Y special), LB (camera behind), RB (look around) and Start (pause); they reach the game as one more pad
 * (pad_sdl.c), so the menus and the bindings of the Controls page work as with a real one. A real pad or a key hides the
 * controls until the screen is touched again. */
